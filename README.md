# indyjs-svelte-talk-Jan-2021

A few small sub-projects for my Indy JS Jan 20, 2021 talk: An Introduction To Svelte

This is a multi-repo, so each folder is a package/project. Just cd to the folder, do:

`yarn` to install then
`yarn start` to start the project running.

The projects are very simple, more oriented towards testing out the snowpack, Svelte and the corresponding UI toolkit.

## Project folders

- `basic-svelte-snowpack`: is a basic snowpack Typescript example
- `f7-svelte-snowpack`: is a basic snowpack Typescript example using Framework7
- `material-web-components-svelte-snowpack`: is a very basic snowpack Typescript example using Material Web Components
- `shoelace-svelte-snowpack`: is a very basic snowpack Typescript example using Shoelace Web Components
- `tailwind-svelte-snowpack`: is a very basic snowpack Typescript example using Tailwind CSS
